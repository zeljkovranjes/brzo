# Brzo

This is my own SaaS boilerplate kit. Does not come with a pre-built UI, so you will need to build this out yourself. The main reason I did not include a UI is because I'm always experimenting and changing things up, and everybody does it differently. I used my own Better-Auth config, which is something that typically shouldn't really change.

I included Stripe and Amazon SES. I also included the Better Email Harmony plugin. This should help reduce users signing up with throwaway emails.
